To verify that aws-ebs-csi-driver has started, run:

    kubectl get pod -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "aws-ebs-csi-driver.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}"

NOTE: The [CSI Snapshotter](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter) controller and CRDs will no longer be installed as part of this chart and moving forward will be a prerequisite of using the snap shotting functionality.
