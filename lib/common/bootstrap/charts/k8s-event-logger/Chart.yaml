description: 'This chart runs a pod that simply watches Kubernetes Events and logs
  them to stdout in JSON to be collected and stored by your logging solution, e.g.
  [fluentd](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/fluentd) or [fluent-bit](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/fluent-bit).  https://github.com/max-rocket-internet/k8s-event-logger  Events
  in Kubernetes log very important information. If are trying to understand what happened
  in the past then these events show clearly what your Kubernetes cluster was thinking
  and doing. Some examples:  - Pod events like failed probes, crashes, scheduling
  related information like `TriggeredScaleUp` or `FailedScheduling` - HorizontalPodAutoscaler
  events like scaling up and down - Deployment events like scaling in and out of ReplicaSets
  - Ingress events like create and update  The problem is that these events are simply
  API objects in Kubernetes and are only stored for about 1 hour. Without some way
  of storing these events, debugging a problem in the past very tricky. '
