# In GKE Autopilot clusters, only /var/log/pods is needed to get the workload logs.
#
#    /var/lib/docker/containers is not needed as Autopilot clusters don't support docker.
#    /run/promtail should be optimally a shared volume, however it works (but might send duplicates on restart) if you define it as emptyDir
