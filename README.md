**Qovery Engine** is an open-source abstraction layer library that turns easy apps deployment on **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**, and other Cloud providers in just a few minutes. The Qovery Engine is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and takes advantage of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), [Helm](https://helm.sh), [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to manage resources.

## Demo

Here is a demo from [Qovery CLI](https://docs.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/interface/cli/) from where we use the Qovery Engine. 

[![Qovery CLI](https://asciinema.org/a/370072.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/370072)

## Getting Started
### Installation
Use the Qovery Engine as a Cargo dependency.
```toml
qovery-engine = { git = "https://github.com/Qovery/engine", branch="main" }
```

### Usage

#### Rust lib
Initialize EKS (AWS Kubernetes) and ECR (AWS container registry) on AWS 
```rust
let engine = Engine::new(
    context, // parameters
    local_docker, // initialize Docker as a Build Platform
    ecr, // initialize Elastic Container Registry
    aws, // initialize AWS account
    cloudflare, // initialize Cloudflare as DNS Nameservers
);

let session = match engine.session() {
    Ok(session) => session, // get the session
    Err(config_error) => panic!("configuration error {:?}", config_error),
};

let mut tx = session.transaction();

// create EKS (AWS managed Kubernetes cluster)
tx.create_kubernetes(&eks);

// create the infrastructure and wait for the result
match tx.commit() { 
    TransactionResult::Ok => println!("OK"),
    TransactionResult::Rollback(commit_err) => println!("ERROR but rollback OK"), 
    TransactionResult::UnrecoverableError(commit_err, rollback_err) => println!("FATAL ERROR")
};
```

Deploy an app from a Github repository on AWS
```rust
// create a session before
//------------------------

let mut environment = Environment {...};

let app = Application {
    id: "app-id-1".to_string(),
    name: "app-name-1".to_string(),
    action: Action::Create, // create the application, you can also do other actions
    git_url: "https://github.com/Qovery/node-simple-example.git".to_string(),
    git_credentials: GitCredentials {
        login: "github-login".to_string(), // if the repository is a private one, then use credentials
        access_token: "github-access-token".to_string(),
        expired_at: Utc::now(), // it's provided by the Github API
    },
    branch: "main".to_string(),
    commit_id: "238f7f0454783defa4946613bc17ebbf4ccc514a".to_string(),
    dockerfile_path: "Dockerfile".to_string(),
    private_port: Some(3000),
    total_cpus: "1".to_string(),
    cpu_burst: "1.5".to_string(),
    total_ram_in_mib: 256,
    total_instances: 1,
    storage: vec![], // you can add persistent storage here
    environment_variables: vec![], // you can include env var here
};

// add the app to the environment that we want to deploy
environment.applications.push(app);

// open a transaction
let mut tx = session.transaction();

// request to deploy the environment
tx.deploy_environment(&EnvironmentAction::Environment(environment));

// commit and deploy the environment
tx.commit();
```
*Note: the repository needs to have a Dockerfile at the root.*

## FAQ
### Why does Qovery exist?
At Qovery, we believe that the Cloud must be simpler than what it is today. Our goal is to consolidate the Cloud ecosystem and makes it accessible to any developer, DevOps, and company. Qovery helps people to focus on what they build instead of wasting time doing plumbing stuff.

### What is the difference between `Qovery` and `Qovery Engine`?
[Qovery](https://www.qovery.com) is a Container as a Service platform for developers. It combines the simplicity of Heroku, the reliability of AWS, and the power of Kubernetes. It makes the developer and DevOps life easier to deploy complex applications. 

**Qovery Engine** is the Open Source abstraction layer used by Qovery to abstract the deployment of containers and databases on any Cloud provider.

### Why is the Qovery Engine written in Rust?
Rust is underrated in the Cloud industry. At Qovery, we believe that Rust can help in building resilient, efficient, and performant products. Qovery wants to contribute to make Rust being a significant player in the Cloud industry for the next 10 years.

### Why do you use Terraform, Helm and Kubectl binaries?
The Qovery Engine is designed to operate as an administrator and takes decisions on the output of binaries, service, API, etc. Qovery uses the most efficient tools available in the market to manage resources.
